### User Stories

I broke the project down into the following user stories to get a clear idea of the different components and their functions.

- The user wants to pick a door. ‚úîÔ∏è
- ... to have the goat revealed. ‚úîÔ∏è
- ... to stick with their door (the user will only ever stick). ‚úîÔ∏è
- ... to see if they win or lose. ‚úîÔ∏è
- ... to choose how many games to play. ‚úîÔ∏è
- ... to have their wins and loses recorded and visible. ‚úîÔ∏è
